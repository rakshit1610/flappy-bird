    <p>Flappy Bird is a classic game which is a side-scroller where the <br>
        player 
    controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green <br>pipes without 
    hitting them. Alongside, fireshots will also be generated <br>and move towards 
    the bird. Use the left mouse-click to make the bird <br>jump and dodge the obstacles. </p>
